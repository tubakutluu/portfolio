I am currently in Ankara Turkey. I study International Baccaeuleratte Diploma Programme in Zafer College, and will graduate on 2023 June. 

I was born in 2005, and couldn't escape the urge to create since then. I am the eldest daughter of two architects, who have a massive effect on my ideas and perspective to art. 

Being started education with basic art knowledge, I try to express myself with any material I have my hands on. From early years of my life, I was taught the amazingness of creation, and all sides of being and living as an architect. Fortunately I saw how it suits my way of expression, so all the negative sides I witnessed did not discourage me from dreaming to pursue this career. 

I am interested in lots of things, like a normal person, such as music, cinema, architecture, politics, cultures, languages etc. I believe they are all ways of learning the human nature and mind, which both truly amaze me. Creating and exploring real and abstract places is the exploration of limits of the body and mind, and that's why I tend to wander around these areas of knowledge, they bring inspiration and provoke the curiousity on existence in my stomach.

With all these passions in my hand, I knead the sorrow or joy my life has brought to me to make a use out of them. 

I aim to continue my education, which I started in Ankara TÃ¼rkiye, abroad, and I am looking forward to finding my people who share the same life perspective as me, an environment which allows me express myself and create with no financial and political restrictments. The situation I was raised in urged me to make a way out of this conflict area, and I know I will not settle down until I find the place to fulfil my potential. 

I am not as good with writing as I am with shaping things, so if you want to learn more about me, I suggest you take a tour through this website!

Born in 2005, Turkish, lives and studies in Ankara Turkey.

I use every kinds of materials that I can get my hands on as a way to express the concepts I have been obsessing over. 

Being started education with basic art knowledge, I focus on ideas and practicality rather than aesthetic, this way I express the feeling and/or idea directly.
